# Giovanni's Level Pack 2

A ROM hack of Sonic the Hedgehog for the SEGA Mega Drive/Genesis, initially meant to be an all-purpose modified version of Sonic 1, it has been solely used for the creation of "Giovanni's Level Pack 2", with its usage phased out in favor of the SCE remake of Sonic 1.

# Technical Specifications

- Based on Project Sonic 128, so it features 128x128 chunks + path swappers

## Features

- Object and ring managers to behave like those of Sonic 3 & Knuckles, courtesy of ProjectFM
- Expanded level layouts
- 128-chunk optimization (Mind you, these were designed specifically for GLP2, so compatibility with the original levels is not guaranteed.)
- DynPaletteTransition support (not actually utilized within levels)
- Spin Dash, from Sonic 2
- Super Peel-Out, from Sonic CD
- Drop Dash, from Sonic Mania
